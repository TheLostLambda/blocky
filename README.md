# Blocky
A programmable Minecraft server bot!

## TODO
* Most of my integration tests should be unit tests?
* Add some tests for the random responses?
* Add Minecraft colours and formatting to server messages
* Fix hanging processes (on failed sudo)

## Commands
* Get player location: `/execute positioned as {name} run teleport {name} ~ ~ ~`
